# FSS-tools
The finite-size scaling (FSS) method is a powerful tool for getting universal information of critical phenomena. It estimates universal information from observables of critical phenomena at finite-size systems.

Here, we introduce two FSS methods by using Gaussian process (GP) and a neural network (NN).

#### PREREQUISITES
The module [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org "PyTorch Home") and [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai "GPyTorch Home") are required.

#### Examples
 - [FSS method by GP](examples/bsa.ipynb "Jupyter notebook")
 - [FSS method by NN](examples/nsa.ipynb "Jupyter notebook")

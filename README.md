# FSS-tools
The finite-size scaling (FSS) method is a powerful tool for getting universal information of critical phenomena. It estimates universal information from observables of critical phenomena at finite-size systems.

Here, we introduce two FSS methods by using Gaussian process (GP) and a neural network (NN).
